# PokerusPacer
Pacer for pokerus plus other things

![Example](https://pokefarm.com/upload/Lgreenbunny/forCode/unknown.png)

Meant to be run in tampermonkey, on Firefox, click [this to download into Tampermonkey](https://github.com/Lgreenbunny/PokerusPacer/raw/master/Pokerus%20Pacer%20Userscript%20Main.user.js), or click the .js file on the master branch then click raw at the top right of the next page~ 

It only runs when you're massclicking, but if you don't see the status text at the bottom of the screen, try to refresh the page. If that doesn't work, re-download the script. If THAT doesn't work, leave a comment/make a issue here or PM me on-site!
